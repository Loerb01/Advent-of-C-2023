#Advent of Code 2023, solved using C

A small challenge between a few friends and I. Basic Rules are as follows:
1. Your first solution must be written in C.
2. You may not use any libraries other than those typically included with a complier.
3. You may not write ANY code before the first challenge releases.

The directory structure is:
```
+-- D1
|   +-P1
|   +-P2
+-- D2
|	+-- P1
|	+-- P2
+-- DXX
	+-- P1
	+-- P2
```

Where DXX is the day, P1 is the initial problem, and P2 is the gold star for the day.
Input is stored with the specific problem, subject to change.
